# RAG with LLM using data of finacial glossary from SEBI
 
In this project, we will see an example of RAG with Llama LLM using glossary definition from SEBI on capital markets. We provide the glossary definition as context to LLM to generete response. This is a base version for **experimentation**, this project could be improved to question answering on any docuement for better user interaction. Since the glossary is provided by a recognized institution, it improves the credibility of response from the cahtbot. Also users with less exposure in financial terms can use LLMs to increase their understanding in an interactive and easy way rather distilling large pdf documents
